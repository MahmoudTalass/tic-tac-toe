# Tic Tac Toe Web Project

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. It was developed as part of "Project: Tic Tac Toe" from The Odin Project curriculum.

## Game Description

The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to play against each other. Before starting the game, it asks the players to enter their names. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns marking a square with their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The goal is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The three technologies work together to create an interactive and visually appealing game.

- **HTML**: Used to structure the web page and define the game board grid.
- **CSS**: Used to style the game board, buttons, and other elements, providing a visually pleasing user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and game replay functionality.

## Features

The Tic Tac Toe game project includes the following features:

1. **Player Names**: Before starting the game, it asks both players to enter their names. This allows for a personalized gaming experience.

2. **Turn-based Gameplay**: The game enforces turn-based gameplay, alternating between the two players. Each player gets a chance to mark an empty square on the game board.

3. **Win Conditions**: The game checks for win conditions after each player's turn. It determines if a player has achieved three symbols in a row, declaring them as the winner.

4. **Replay Option**: After a match is over, the game offers the option to replay. If the players choose to replay, the game resets the board and gives the next turn to the player who lost the previous match.

## Project Source
